_**Publish research for free, access research for free.**_

# Digital Science Catalyst Grant Proposal

## Abstract

Our goal is to enhance the current scientific publishing and peer-review systems by leveraging the potential offered by recent technologies such as blockchains and decentralised storage systems. We believe these technologies can make the scientific publication process more efficient, transparent, and fair. Our projet is open-source, backed by a foundation ([Aletheia](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/aletheia-101-kade-morton/)), and aims at getting science published and peer-reviewed into the hands of everyone. 

## Team

[Kade Morton](linkedin.com/in/kade-morton-34179283) and [Roo](https://github.com/roo2) co-founded Aletheia. Kade works as a security consultant and Roo works as a software developer.

Aletheia's volunteer team consists of:

* Chris
* Kolt
* Lisa
* Michael
* Ameen
* Federico
* Rachel
* Dr Rob Syme
* [Yann-Aël Le Borgne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannaelb): Postdoctoral researcher in Machine Learning. University of Brussels, Belgium. 

We've reached out to [Jon Tennant](http://fossilsandshit.com/) who has agreed to serve on an advisory board we are in the course of establishing.

Kade sketched out the basic functionality of Aletheia after watching the documentary *The Internet's Own Boy, The Story of Aaron Swartz*. The documentary opened his eyes to the problems in academic publishing, enough so that he wanted to see what he could do about them. Kade approached Roo, a fellow decentralistion and blockchain enthusiast, to help build Aletheia. Neither Kade or Roo have formal academic publishing experience, which is why they've surrounded themselves with volunteers, many who do have academic publishing experience, to help guide the project. What they do bring to the project is a unique take on privacy, security and resiliency, ensuring that Aletheia will be software that stands the test of time. Both Kade and Roo are involved in activism and also bring to the project a strong purpose of community building. The skill sets of the founders are embodied in the spirit of Aletheia, that the project is both software and people, both hand in hand to create a better world.

## Problem & Solution

A large percentage of scientific papers published are behind paywalls. That is to say, a huge segment of the world's population is cut off from scientific knowledge. Paywalls entrench economic privilege, lower global standards and stifle global innovation. Humanity as an entire race loses out, and that means you. You lose, no matter who you are.  

To fix this problem, we open science up. Academic publishers host scientific research and organise the peer review process, there's no reason why a community of people can't do that. Aletheia is a publishing platform that handles peer review as well as a search engine for papers, anyone can publish through us, have their work peer reviewed, and access the entire Aletheia database, all for free.

We have the ability to create such software and we have the ability to organise a community around it, there is no reason we cannot build the world we want.


## Product

[Aletheia](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/aletheia-whitepaper/blob/master/WHITE-PAPER.md) is an Ethereum Blockchain application utilising IPFS for decentralised storage that anyone can upload documents to, download documents from, that also handles the academic peer review process. The application runs on individual PCs, all forming part of the IPFS database. This gives us an open source platform that cannot be bought out by the large publishers (and any derivatives of the platform source code must also be open source) that should also be hard to take down due to database nodes being spread across the globe in multiple legal jurisdictions. Aletheia is designed to be a resilient platform run transparently by the community, not some black box corporation or editorial board, meaning all users can see the decisions Aletheia is making and have a stake in that decision making process if they so desire. By this nature, Aletheia is decentralised, it has no key person risk. Should the core group who invented Aletheia disappear Aletheia won't cease to exist, it will continue to be run by the community. The community moderates content through various mechanisms (peer review, reputation scores etc.,) to ensure quality of content.

Aletheia is still under development and the volunteer group working on Aletheia aim to have a minimum viable product (MVP) released by the end of the year.

The basic functionality of Aletheia, uploading and downloading academic papers, is free of charge. Currently different monetisaton and fund raising methods are being explored, but basic usage of Aletheia is now, and will always be, free.

The long term vision is to provide a better version of current academic journals. Aletheia will provide people with the option of publishing and accessing content for free, will incentivise quality peer review and provides a transparent activity score that shows papers submitted, peer reviews performed along with other things to bring scientific rigour to emmanence. We are also excited to be building an open source [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)) that others can use to create decentralised autonomous organisations.

## Competitors

Currently people publish in either paywall or Open Access journals. People seeking academic journals that aren't in the public domain either have to pay a hefty fee, try to obtain pdfs from authors directly or use websites like Sci-Hub that pirate academic papers.

Aletheia's competitors are paywall journals, existing Open Access journals and pre-print servers could also be seen as competitors but are viewed more as allies in the same struggle. Aletheia is open source so that existing Open Access projects can use parts of Aletheia to enhance their own this means our competitors are well established, but so are our allies.

The way we differentiate ourselves from current open access journals is we’re also free to submit to. We think based on some of the technologies we’re using we can keep costs extremely low and run off donations and perhaps some paid functionality, but the core functionality of you upload and download articles will always be free. We're also not a business. We aren’t going to fold like a lot of open access journals do because they don’t post profit. We are an open source volunteer organisation. As long as people are willing to donate time to the project it can’t die.

We differentiate ourselves from pre-print archives by providing peer review. Because we can track history and decisions through our blockchain elements we can handle version control of documents and peer review comments. The application can let you register qualifications if you want, and when you upload a document you can request a peer review from people qualified in a set field or from anyone in the community if you’d rather. Choice is yours. People get notifications on what’s pending peer review, they can submit comments, once a pre-set number of people peer review the document it goes back to the submitter, they incorporate comments and resubmit. We can do peer review just as good if not better than paywall journals.

Aletheia's selling point over all existing publication offerings is our community management framework, allowing the community to run and have a stake in the decisions of Aletheia.

## Market

Everyone conducting research globally and everyone studying globally are potential users of Aletheia. It's expected that Aletheia will see greatest uptake among researchers and students in developing nations, but the platform will be useful to users the world over.

Once the Aletheia MVP is released, volunteers will pitch news stories to tech news websites to generate coverage. We currently have two volunteers, Kade and Lisa that attend public speaking engagements to evangelise Aletheia, and outreach to the academic community is continuing. On this front, Kade is engaging with groups like [Blockchain for Science](http://www.blockchainforscience.com/) and others to deepen Aletheia's connection to existing groups. Monetisation of the platform will allow for the hiring of dedicated staff to both work on the development of the platform and building our reputation in the market, helping us both retain existing users and gain new ones.

## Progress to date

The current state of the business is that a legal entity in the form of a not for profit has been established in Australia. A business plan is being drawn along with a bank account and cryptocurrency wallet being opened in the name of the Foundation to properly manage funds. We have no financials at this stage ad the MVP has not yet launched. It's expected that the business side of the project will be in place for the MVP launch, and volunteers are currently working on the MVP to bring it to market.

At the beginning of the design process Kade validated all the claims made in the documentary *The Internet's Own Boy*. [Here](https://medium.com/@jasonschmitt/can-t-disrupt-this-elsevier-and-the-25-2-billion-dollar-a-year-academic-publishing-business-aa3b9618d40a), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Criticism_and_controversies), [here](https://arstechnica.com/science/2008/11/elsevier-beyond-the-pale-of-scientific-respectability/) and [here](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/02/academics-boycott-publisher-elsevier) are links to some articles that validate the claims in the documentary. Once Kade was sufficently convinced there were real problems to solve in this space he set about designing Aletheia.

Currently with the MVP not yet released there aren't any figures available to draw growth forecasts from.
